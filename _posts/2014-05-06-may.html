		<h4>Multi-Model Databases</h4>
		<p>In many modern applications the database side is realized using polyglot persistence â€“ store each data format (graphs, documents, etc.) in an appropriate separate database. This approach yields several benefits, databases are optimized for their specific duty, however there are also drawbacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>keep all databases in sync</li>
      <li>queries might require data from several databases</li>
      <li>experts needed for all used systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p> A multi-model database is not restricted to one data format, but can cope with several of them. In this talk i will present how a multi-model database can be used in a polyglot persistence setup and how it will reduce the effort drastically.</p>
