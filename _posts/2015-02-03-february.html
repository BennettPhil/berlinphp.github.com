                  <h4>Introduction to RabbitMQ</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>Do you need to process thousands of images in the background for your web app? </p>

<p>Do you need to share data across multiple applications, probably written in different languages and sitting at different servers?</p>

<p>Your real time data feed is becoming slow because you are polling the database constantly for new data updates?</p>

<p>Do you need to scale information processing during peek times?</p>

<p>What about deploying new features with zero downtime? If any of these problems sound familiar then you probably need to use messaging in your application.</p>

<p></p>In this talk I will introduce RabbitMQ, a messaging and queue server that can help us tackle those problems. We will learn the benefits of a Queue Server and see how to integrate messaging into our applications. With this talk we hope that the term 'decoupling' gets a new, broader, meaning.</p>

                  <h4>A CouchDB replication endpoint in PHP</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>This talk shows how I implemented a replication endpoint for the CouchDB replication protocol in PHP. This makes it possible to use about any backend as a synchronization point for Offline-First HTML5 applications powered by tools like PouchDB or TouchDB.</p>
                  <p></p>You will also be able to replicate a CouchDB database into a MySQL database or vice-versa. The growing amount of endpoints for this protocol in different languages and environments suggests that the CouchDB replication protocol might evolve as a standard for eventual consistent multi-master replication.</p>
