				<h4>Code of Conduct</h5>
				<p>
					We're excellent to each other. :-) Any form of discrimination will not be tolerated.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Our goal is to have an awesome, inclusive and safe community meetup where people meet,
					hang out together, chat, listen to talks, exchange ideas and make new friends.
					Any harmful or discriminating behaviour will not be tolerated and results
					in the offending person being expelled from the meetup.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For details on what kinds of behaviour are not tolerated and consequences for violating these rules, we refer to the <a href="http://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/">Berlin Code of Conduct</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case you have questions, concerns or anything else, please talk to <a href="imprint.html">the organizers</a>.
